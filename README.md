For adRespect community:
Hello, I did everything as in your design, but with the masonry gallery it didn't quite work out for me like you did, in the plan, I made a semi-transparent effect for the pictures that fit to the end of the container, but I didn't understand how you managed to do it the effect of gradual translucency, that is, the closer the image is to the end of the container, the more transparent it is, it will be very interesting to hear and learn from you, of course if I go further, thank you for the opportunity)
